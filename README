Please note that this is not hot-shit coding. It's a small part-time project, and per my usual approach, I half-ass it until 
it mostly work, then call it "production-ready!"

This is the application directory for a CodeIgniter app. You'll need to set up your index.php file in the doc root as set 
paths appropriately.

You'll also want to make cache/ and logs/ dirs in this directory, and make them writable by the user PHP is executing as.
